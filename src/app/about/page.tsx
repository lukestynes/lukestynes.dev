                    Iâ€™m a fourth year software engineering student currently
                    studying at the University of Canterbury based in
                    Christchurch, New Zealand, with my graduation date currently
                    set to be November 2025. I have experience across a broad
                    range of subjects throughout my degree, including
                    networking, advanced security, full-stack development,
                    computer vision, and many more.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Combining my skills in design, engineering, and business I
                    work to craft elevating digital experiences with a unique
                    perspective. I have a passion for designing creative
                    solutions and am always looking for new opportunities to
                    expand my knowledge and skill set. I have a love of
                    entrepreneurship and am always interested in new business
                    ventures.
                    <br />
                    <br /> Outside of software I like to keep myself busy with
                    numerous hobbies. From bouldering and climbing,
                    snowboarding, weightlifting, and cooking, I always have
                    something to keep me occupied. I also have a passion for
                    travel and have been lucky enough to visit many countries
                    around the world, and I can't wait to finish my studies so I
                    can head overseas and explore the world.
